# Example of using elm-canvas with create-elm-app

The [elm-canvas package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/joakin/elm-canvas/latest/) uses a custom element. This means including external javascript. The necessary javascript is published as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-canvas). The purpose of this example is to show how to use such custom javascript from npm with an elm project that is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

The only extra step that should be required after cloning this repo is `npm install elm-canvas`.

Trees.elm example comes from the [elm-canvas repo](https://github.com/joakin/elm-canvas/tree/master/examples). See LICENSE.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
